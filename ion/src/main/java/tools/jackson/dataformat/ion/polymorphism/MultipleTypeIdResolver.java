/**
 * This is an extension of {@link TypeIdResolver} for serializing and deserializing polymorphic types. The vanilla
 * implementation of TypeIdResolver only enables a single type id to be serialized with a value, which is not always
 * sufficient for every consumer of a value with polymorphic typing to identify and instantiate the appropriate type.
 * <p>
 * This allows more robust polymorphism support, in that consumers of a serialized polymorphic object do not need
 * complete type information. As long as their deserializer can resolve (or, understand) one of the annotated type ids,
 * they can still perform polymorphic deserialization. An example:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * class BasicMessage {
 *      String id;
 *      String message;
 * }
 * class SocialMediaMessage extends BasicMessage {
 *      boolean cool;
 * }
 *</pre>
 * Let's say we serialized a value into:
 *<pre>
 *      {id="123",message="hi",cool=false}.
 *</pre>
 * The existing polymorphism support may have annotated this as the following Ion:
 *<pre>
 *      SocialMediaMessage::{id="123",message="hi",cool=false}
 *</pre>
 * But a consumer who only has BasicMessage in its classloader won't know (or care) what a SocialMediaMessage is, and be
 * stuck. Using this interface enables the following serialization:
 *<pre>
 *      SocialMediaMessage::BasicMessage::{id="123",message="hi",cool=false}
 *</pre>
 * About particular implementations:
 * <p>
 * Ion serialization should be using {@link IonAnnotationTypeSerializer}, which is polymorphism-aware, but how should a
 * MultipleTypeIdResolver handle a call to the non-polymorphic {@link TypeIdResolver#idFromValue}? I'd probably
 * do something like {@code return selectId(idsFromValue(value)); }, to keep things working when serializing
 * to non-Ion formats. Throwing a runtime exception is another idea, if you want to forbid non-Ion serialization.
